# movie-app
A simple application in React, to demonstrate concepts taught in the Exeter Computer Science Society React course

This informative course was led by students on comittee of or known to the Exeter Computer Science Society this year, with experience developing using React and Javascript. The sessions were weekly with an informative powerpoint talking us through core concepts such as components and hooks, followed by an interactive segment where we implemented the code to create the movie app. I was awarded a certificate for attending all the sessions. While the original code is copied from the tutorial, I have made some adjustments since the course finished, working with the HeartToggle hook to get the heart to change colour correctly. I am hoping to further develop my skills using Javascript and React or similar libraries.
